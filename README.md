# Portrait Artist Website annagilhespy.com

Comprehensive website for a traditional portrait artist based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

* Drive sales in the form of first contact (via the contact page) and a sales call/skype from the artist. 
* Excellent UX to keep potential clients on site long enough to place an order.

The customer goals of this website are:
* Searching for high quality, bespoke artwork for their home or treasured gift. 
* Clear easy to find pricing.

## UX

#### Ideal client

##### The ideal client for this business is:
* English speaking.
* With disposable income.
* A parent.
* Living in the Netherlands (but can be anywhere in the world).

##### They are searching for:
* An artist to create a custom portrait featuring their child(ren) to decorate their home. 
* And/or a bespoke gift. 

##### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
* Most artists' websites have very poor UX. 
* Other artists' websites are over complicated and produce information overload quickly. 
* My site is easy to navigate, stepping the client through easy to understand learnable information and guiding them to the goal of the website - to fill out the contact form.

## Features

Each page features a **header** with conventional placing of **logo** (top left) and **navigation bar** (top right), 
and a **footer** with **copyright information** (bottom left) and **social media icons** (bottom right) linking to the artists' Facebook, Instagram and Flickr pages. 

Every page features its own **hero image** at the top, detailing a drawing or painting by the artist. 
The purpose of the hero image is to grab attention and give a positive emotional response to the user. 
*The one exception to this is the Error page, which does not include an image*

##### Home

The artists' **tagline** is placed under the hero image and continues the emotional response.

The home page features an embedded **promotional video** hosted by YouTube, further engaging the user and telling them the value of the products on offer.

After the promotional video is some **compelling copy** which reinforces the emotional response to the artist's work and the users desire to add it to their lives.

Finally there is a simple **call to action button** guiding the user on their next step through the website - to *Visit the Gallery*.

##### About

The About page features **two photographs** of the artist in her studio, 
as well as some brief but compelling copy about her, her work and process. 
*Enough information to satisfy curiosity without overwhelming the user*.

At the bottom of the page (above the footer) are two **call to action buttons**: *Visit Gallery* and *How to Order*.

##### Gallery

The Gallery page is laid out in **columns of thumbnail images**, 2 columns wide for mobile devices, 4 columns wide for tablets and 5 columns wide for desktop. 
Each thumbnail features a drawing or painting by the artist. 

Each can be clicked to open a **fancybox** window to view the artwork in detail, 
to move on to the next image, view the previous one, or return to the gallery page.

At the bottom of the gallery page the user is guided to choose from two **call to action buttons**: To view *Pricing* or learn *How to Order*. 

##### Pricing

The pricing page features **two tables**, which list example sizes of artwork and guideline prices. 
One table for drawings and a second one for paintings. 

Below the tables some **text** briefly explains why the prices given are guideline only and encourages the user to request a quote for their own custom order.

At the bottom of the page the **call to action button** guides the user to learn *How to Order*.

##### How to Order

The How to Order page features a **numbered timeline** listing the 5 steps involved in ordering a custom artwork.
Each step features a large, obvious icon, and a brief learnable explanation of the step.

Below the order timeline the user is informed how long their order is likely to take to be completed, one **timescale** each for drawings and paintings.

At the bottom of the page the **call to action button** guides the user to *Request a Quote* and they are taken to the *Contact* page.

##### Contact

The Contact page features a **contact form**, which requests client name, email, phone number, and gives a box to leave a message. 
At the bottom of the form clients can **upload** photograph(s) they want the artist to use. 

The bottom of the form contains a **Send Button** which when clicked changes from *Send* to *Processing* and then when complete changes to *Sent*.

## Technologies Used - UPDATE WHEN COMPLETE

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other 
tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its 
official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)
    - The project uses **BootstrapCDN** to simplify the structure of the website and make the website responsive easily.
    - The project also uses BootstrapCDN to provide icons from [FontAwesome](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/)
- [fancybox](https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/)
    - The project uses **Fancybox** to view images in the gallery.
- [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - The project uses **Hover.css** to simplify UX

## Testing - STILL TO COMPLETE

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing 
to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want 
to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as 
intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve
their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief
explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide 
as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process 
is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered 
during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment - STILL TO COMPLETE

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
