# Portrait Artist Website annagilhespy.com

Comprehensive website for a traditional portrait artist based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

The business goals of this website are:
* Build brand awareness.
* Provide high quality examples of the artist's drawings and paintings.

* Excellent UX to keep potential clients on site long enough to place an order.

The customer goals of this website are:
* Searching for high quality, bespoke artwork for their home or treasured gift. 
* Clear easy to find pricing.
* Intuitive ordering process.
 
## UX

#### Ideal client

##### The ideal client for this business is:
* English speaking.
* With disposable income.
* A parent.
* Living in the Netherlands (but can be anywhere in the world).

##### They are searching for:
* An artist to create a custom portrait featuring their child(ren) to decorate their home.

* This website is 
    * easy to navigate.

## Features

Each page features a responsive **navigation bar** with conventional placing of **logo** (top left) and a highlighted "request a quote" button in the top right.
Each page has a **footer** with **copyright information** and **social media icons**linking to 5 the artists' social media pages. 

Every page - except the home page - features its own **hero image** at the top, detailing a drawing or painting by the artist, 
or in the case of the about page, a photo of the artist in her studio. 
The purpose of the hero image is to grab attention and give a positive emotional response to the user. 

##### Home

The Home page features a special hero image _or_ video. On mobile and tablet devices a full screen static image is seen. 
On desktops this is replaced with a promotional video, which autoplays on mute as a background element. Both of these elements have the page header displayed as an overlay.
The purpose of this hero image/video element is to give maximum impact on arriving at the website, while not using up people's data unnessasarily on mobile and tablet devices.

The home page **promotional video** hosted by Vimeo, engages the user and tells them the value of the products on offer.

After the special hero image/video is some **compelling copy** which reinforces the emotional response to the artist's work and the potential client's desire to add it to their lives.

Finally there is a simple **call to action button** guiding the user on their next step through the website - to *Visit the Gallery*.

##### About

The About page features **two photographs** of the artist in her studio, one professional headshot photograph, and a professional photograph of a painting in a fancy apartment.
The about page also includes some brief but compelling copy about the artist. 
*Enough information to satisfy curiosity without overwhelming the user*.

At the bottom of the page (above the footer) are two **call to action buttons**: *Visit Gallery* and *How to Order*. The How to Order button is highlighted. 

##### Gallery

The Gallery page is laid out in **columns of thumbnail images**, 2 columns wide for mobile devices, 3 columns wide for tablets and 6 columns wide for desktop. 
Each thumbnail is square and features a drawing or painting by the artist. 

Each can be clicked to open a **fancybox** window to view the artwork in detail, 
to move on to the next image, view the previous one, or return to the gallery page.

At the bottom of the gallery page the user is guided to choose from two **call to action buttons**: To view *Pricing* or learn *How to Order*. Again, the How to Order button is highlighted.

##### Pricing

The pricing page features **two tables**, which list example sizes of artwork and guideline prices. 
One table for drawings and a second one for paintings. The tables are displayed next to each other on desktop and tablet, and stacked on top of each other for mobiles.

Below the tables some **small print** briefly explains why the prices given are guideline only and encourages the user to request a quote for their own custom order.

At the bottom of the page the **call to action button** guides the user to learn *How to Order*.

##### How to Order

The How to Order page features the **5 numbered steps** involved in ordering a custom artwork.
Each step features a large, obvious icon, and a brief learnable explanation of the step.

Below the order timeline the user is informed how long their order is likely to take to be completed, one **timescale** each for drawings and paintings.

At the bottom of the page the **call to action button** guides the user to *Request a Quote* and they are taken to the *Contact* page.

##### Contact

The Contact page features a **contact form**, which requests client name and email, provides a place to upload a photograph, and below that a box to leave a message. 
At the bottom of the form clients can **upload** photograph(s) they want the artist to use. 

The bottom of the form contains a **Send Button**

## Technologies Used - UPDATE WHEN COMPLETE

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other 
tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its 
official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap4** to simplify the structure of the website and make the website responsive easily.
    - The project also uses BootstrapCDN to provide icons from [FontAwesome](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/)
- [fancybox](https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/)
    - The project uses **Fancybox** to view images in the gallery.
- [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - The project uses **Hover.css** to simplify UX

## Testing - STILL TO COMPLETE

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing 
to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want 
to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as 
intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve
their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief
explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide 
as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process 
is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered 
during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment - STILL TO COMPLETE

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
